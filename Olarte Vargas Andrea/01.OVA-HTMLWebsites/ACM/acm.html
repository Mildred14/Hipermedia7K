The revised Code of Ethics addresses <br>the significant advances in computing technology since the 1992 version, as well as the growing <br>pervasiveness of computing in all aspects of society. ACM’s Code of Ethics is considered the standard <br>for the computing profession, and has been adopted by computing professionals, organizations and <br>technology companies around the world. The Code is a collection of principles and guidelines designed <br>to help computing professionals make ethically responsible decisions in professional practice.</p>

                        <p>Online social networks are not only huge in scale, they are predicted to keep growing in the coming years both in the number of users and in the amount of data users upload and share. There have been many efforts devoted to study privacy in social media and how to protect users' personal information since the very early days of social media. However, most of these efforts have focused on privacy from an individual point of view. Privacy is not just about what you say or disclose about yourself. It is also about what others say or disclose about you. In this video, Jose M. Such discusses "Multiparty Privacy in Social Media,” a Review Article in the August 2018 issue of <i>Communications of the ACM</i>.</p>

In this installment, Dan Crankshaw and Joey Gonzalez provide an overview of machine learning server systems. What happens when we wish to actually deploy a machine learning model to production, and how do we serve predictions with high accuracy and high computational efficiency? Dan and Joey’s curated research selection presents cutting-edge techniques spanning database-level integration, video processing, and prediction middleware. Given the explosion of interest in machine learning and its increasing impact on seemingly every application vertical, it's possible that systems such as these will become as commonplace as relational databases are today. </p>
